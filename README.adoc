= State Handling in Vue.js

NOTE: This repository has been archived as it targets Vue 2 which is now outdated.

== Why this repo exists

This is demo repository that that I use for a presentation called "Handling State in Vue.js Applications".

You can find the slides online on https://speakerdeck.com/ahus1/handling-state-in-vue-dot-js-applications[Speakerdeck]

== What you can find here

The code examples shows how state can be handled:

* Minimal: Single Component
* Hierarchy: Parent-Child
* Horizontal: Event Bus
* Inversion of State: Simple Global State
* Inversion of State: Vuex

== Disclaimer

The code examples are minimal, opinionated, and show only these concepts.
Before implementing any on these patterns in production, please evaluate them thoroughly.
The code examples are so very minimal that other features for production ready code (like tests, error handling etc.) are missing.
